- Deltas over traditional callgraph construction
   -- incorporating multiple applications into a single callgraph
       --- combining functions that may be running in different environments with limited shared state
   -- flow through services via triggers/events
       --- statically resolvable tables, level of granularity for analysis
       --- approach for considering libraries (summaries of library calls instead of importing)
           --- statelessness improving ability to reason about (lack of) globally stored state
   -- services as sources/sinks
           --- Potential for analysis of "risky" behaviors (e.g writing to disk on a shared container)
- Language agnostic framework for considering serverless callgraphs
